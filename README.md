# MUVUS

<p>Home of Tv-Series, movies, people and communities!</p>
<p>Created with nextjs, firebase, nextauth, tailwindcss and sass.</p>

## How I Worked On This Project

<p>My goal was to simulate a professional environment</p>

-   I got my inspiration from this [dribble design](https://dribbble.com/shots/15558638-Movie-Dashboard-Design-Dark-Mode)
-   I used feature branches and pull requests: [Example PR](https://github.com/Olaleye-Blessing/muvus/pull/11)

## Why I Built This Project

-   Starting with tailwindcss in my previous project, I realised my code was kind of messy. So I decided to implement scss with this, in order to have more cleaner code.
-   My plan is to become a full-stack developer eventually, but realised there'd be need for backend(at least a database) for my current projects. So I decided to build this to learn how firebase works.
-   Curosity about how nextjs server side works also pushed me into building this.

## How To Navigate This Project

-   The application fetches data from [TMDB Api](https://developers.themoviedb.org/). [Example of API request](https://github.com/Olaleye-Blessing/muvus/blob/master/pages/search.jsx)
-   Different pages used can be found in [pages folder](https://github.com/Olaleye-Blessing/muvus/tree/master/pages)

## If I had more time, I would do this

-   Testing has always been something I want to lay my hands on. So definitely, I'd carry out different testings.
-   Refactor some of the code and have better folder structure
